## **Q1Problem**
1. According to the background, dataset should have time attribute which can show the specific time as plankton change their distributions from day to night. However, there is no row to specify time showing in the table in these three files to collect data from day to night.
2. According to the background, it mentions that the investigators want to examine the two species of zooplankton across multiple years. However, the year of dataset only shows ne year which is 2011.
3. Confusing variable. In the file “pond2010”, there is a confusing column called “z”, we don’t know what this column means.
4. No unit of measurement for some variable. For example, temperature variable, it doesn’t mention is it degree Celsius or Fahrenheit degree.
5. Missing data. There is some missing data in both “pond2010” and “zoop-temp-main” files.
6. Confusing fields and data. Some fields have highlight, some data shows red color and some shows orange color. However, there are no any explanation and introduction about the meaning of highlight and differences of text color.
7. Ambiguous graph. There is no title and labels for the graph, which makes us confused about the meaning of graph.
8. Confusing data. In “zoop-temp-main” file, field H23 is confusing data “*”, it doesn’t mention the meaning of “*”, which makes us confused.  
9. Unreliable data analysis. In the file “zoop-temp”, it mentions at the beginning that the Max Depth is 72m. However, based on the data provided, we can see that the Max Depth is 50, which means it may lose some data and results unreliable data analysis.
