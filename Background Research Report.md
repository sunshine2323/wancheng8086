### **Old Woman Creek:**
As one of Ohio’s best remaining examples of a natural estuary, Old Woman Creek is located in Erie Country, Ohio. The site is 572 acres in size, and it features hiking trails, an observation deck, and a handicap-accessible visitor center (Platt, 2016). With geographical advantage and working as transition zone between land and water, Old Woman Creek contains a variety of habitats including marshes and swamps, upland forests, open water, tributary streams, barrier beach and near shore Lake Erie. All these different habitats feed different types of organisms including birds, eagles, plants and so on. Since with so many types of habitats, Old Woman Creek is protected as State Nature Preserve and National Estuarine Research Reserve, which is also served as a field laboratory that provides lots of opportunities for scientists to study the naturally functioning system and how the natural affect the organisms. For visitors, they can learn about the Great Lakes, Lake Erie water problems, northern Ohio weather and its effects on the estuary, and diverse habitats found on the preserve. The preserve is owned and managed by the Ohio Department of Natural Resource’s Division of Wildlife, in partnership with the federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Ohio DNR Division of Wildlife [APA], n.d.).

### **Study Organism or Phenomenon:**
With the climate change and human impact, how these natural and manual changing trends will impact the natural environment becomes a hot topic nowadays. With more than 90 percent of Ohio’s historical wetlands have been lost, estuarine ecosystems are crucial to the health of the lake, but virtually all estuaries along Ohio’s Lake Erie shoreline have been affected by human development. As one of the last naturally functioning estuaries along Ohio’s shoreline, that is the reason why Old Woman Creek is protected. Since the site offers hiking, overlooking and visitor centers, visitors, scientists and people who interest estuarine ecosystems can watch close-up of the varieties of species based on habitat preferences. The existence of Old Woman Creek is to provide the opportunities for scientists and visitors to observe and track how the climate change affect the species choosing their habitats (“Old Woman Creek features freshwater estuary, wetlands, woods, hikes, paddles, visitor center”, 2013). In our project, we will concentrate two datasets which include AVIAN monitoring data and Bald Eagle nest monitoring data.

### **AVIAN Monitoring:**
With thousands of species of birds, human influences such as logging and urbanization have reduced natural habitat. The Old Woman Creek, with nearly 300 spices of birds, is also one of 80 Ohio spots on the Lake Erie Birding Trail. The site is highly recommended for bird watching. There are five different habitats which represent five different types of trails. The first habitat is green trail which represents Northwest direction and lower estuary loop. The second habitat is blue trail which represents Southwest direction and estuary overlook around the visitor center. The third habitat is red trail which represents Southeast direction and upland woods boardwalk. The forth is yellow trail which represents Northeast direction and early successional access. The fifth habitat is purple trail, which is prairie access and diagonal between early successional and upland woods. Walking around different trails, visitors can see different species of birds, insects, plants and so on based on different habitats (Platt, 2016).

With different trails, birds are in different places depending on their habitat preferences. How to collect the AVIAN Monitoring data requires citizen scientists or volunteers come to the point and stand there 15 minutes for observation, and record everything they see and hear in that 15 minutes. Then, the citizen scientists or volunteers require fill out the form which contains the critical attributes for the dataset. Based on the analysis of the following collecting data on AVIAN monitoring, our team want to get better idea about how the species of birds will choose their habitat preferences based on climate change or other factors.

Variable (OWC data sheet):
* Avian Monitoring Route
* Date
* Observer
* Weather: Temperature, Cloud Cover, Wind Speed, Wind Direction, Humidity
* Precipitation
* Vegetation: %cover
* Equipment
* Start Time
* End Time
* Sound Distance
* Time of Observation
* Species Code
* Heard/Seen
* Number of Birds

### **Bald Eagle Nest Monitoring:**
Bald eagles live near rivers, lakes and marches where they can find fish. Except fish, they also feed on waterfowl, turtles, rabbits, snakes and other small animals and carrion. According to the client’s documentations, it mentions that population of bald eagle declined initially due to hunting around 100 years ago. There were various of reasons making bald eagle endangered including habitat destruction and degradation, illegal shooting, and the contamination of its food source. Besides human impact, the chemical DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) pesticide was commonly used on farms, and found its way flow into rivers, streams and lakes, which was regarded as another big reason making bald eagle endangered as fish the main food for eagles became contaminated. In addition, caused by DDT, eagle egg shells were extremely thin and therefore crushed during the incubation period without hatching success. Thus, in 1959, only 15 pairs of eagles were found in Ohio. And bald eagle nest monitoring at Old Woman Creek was initiated by the State of Ohio in an effort to track eagle recovery in response to the DDT crisis and subside around 1999 (“U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.”, 2009).

However, with contributions of the Endangered Species and Wildlife Program and banned DDT, eagles had a population climb from the early ‘90s and on. In 2004, 100 nesting pairs were found statewide. In 2005, there were over 125 breeding pairs. In 2006, Ohio marked 150 nests and in 2007, 164 nests were found in the state, with 115 successful in producing young eagles. In 2009, 197 eagles were produced from 113 nests. Through habitat protection and reintroduction programs from the Division of Wildlife, there are more than 20 times as many pairs in Ohio today (“U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.”, 2009). 

Based on the eagle datasets and the client’s requirement, Eagle data is split into two-time frames which include 1996-1999 years and 2016-2018 years. Behavioral changes observed suggested shifts in nesting phases from incubation, to hatching, to feeding. In the site, citizen scientists seek to observe, track and document important indicator and keystone species to understand how climate change impacts their habits and ecosystem as a whole (OWC video). 

How to collect bald eagle nesting monitoring data is observing the nest activities for roughly half an hour or 45 minutes as long as volunteers or citizen scientists stand there to keep track of adult eagles coming and going, their behaviors and weather to see how the weather impact their activities (OWC video).

Variable (OWC data sheet):
* Eagle Nest Destination
* Observer’s direction to nest
* Nest Condition
* Nest Status
* Date
* Observer
* Weather: Temperature, Cloud Cover %, Wind Velocity/Direction, Precipitation
* Equipment
* Start Time
* End Time
* Time of Each Observation
* #Birds Present & Plumages
* #Birds on Nest
* Behavior of Adults
* Approx. # of Eggs
* Approx. # of Chicks
* If feeding, characteristics of prey
* Additional Comments

Based on the analysis of the above attributes of Bald Eagle nesting Monitoring data, our team want to know more about how climate impacts bald eagle nesting behaviors.
